Hi, there! I am a developer who is studying Web Technology and Statistics. I wanted to improve life with technology, so I started to study FrontEnd and BackEnd. I majored in Statistics and Law, and I really love numbers and gouda cheese! Of course I love JavaScript & R as much as gouda. I am slowly but steadily mature, like gouda! I'm studying English and Japanese. Please point out the wrong part. Welcome anytime.
